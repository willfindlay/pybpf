# PyBPF 🐍💞🐝

An opinionated libbpf/BPF CO-RE library for the Python3 (read Python3.6+) ecosystem.

**DISCLAIMER:** This library is in **pre-alpha** version and changes may result in
API breakages. Pre-release version API breakages will be accompanied by a minor
version number bump. Versions post 1.0.0 will follow semantic visioning and
breakages will require a bump in major version number.
